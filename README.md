Programs for aerospace applications.

Split into aerodynamics, stability, and propulsion categories (control code may be added, but probably not cause it's harder than simulink).

- Aerodynamics contains incompressible (potential flow theory) and compressible applications.
- Propulsion contains programs that automate the jet engine design process.
- Stability contains a calculator for stability derivatives based on aircraft geometry
